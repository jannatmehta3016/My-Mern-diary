### 📌 Topics Covered:
Exploring Middleware, Route Parameters, and Modular Routing in Express.js

### 💻 What I Did:
  Today's session was packed with new Express.js features that make the backend more powerful and structured. I started by diving deeper into **middleware**, which acts as a bridge between the request and response cycle.




### 🧱 Custom Middleware:
I wrote a custom middleware to log request information:
```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} request received at ${req.url}`);
  next(); // continue to the route handler
});
```

This really helped me understand how requests pass through layers before reaching the final route handler. It also made debugging and tracking much easier.

### 📦 Route Parameters:
I also explored **dynamic routing** using route parameters. Here's what I implemented:
```js
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  res.send(`User ID is ${userId}`);
});
```

This allowed me to fetch the dynamic `id` from the URL (e.g., `/users/101`) and use it in logic. Route parameters will be super helpful when building REST APIs with unique identifiers for users, products, posts, etc.

### 📁 Modular Routing:
As applications grow, routing can get messy in one file. I learned how to create **separate route modules** for cleaner code:
#### `routes/student.js`:
```js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('All students');
});

router.get('/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Student ID: ${req.params.id}`);
});

module.exports = router;
```
#### `server.js`:
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const studentRoutes = require('./routes/student');

app.use('/students', studentRoutes);
```

This gave my app a professional structure and made it easy to maintain multiple routes across different files.

### 🧠 Reflections:
Understanding how to structure large apps and use features like middleware and modular routing is a game-changer. It felt like I went from writing a simple script to designing an actual backend system.

I'm starting to see how Express can scale — whether for small projects or production-grade systems. These practices will definitely help me as I continue building the backend for MERN stack apps.
