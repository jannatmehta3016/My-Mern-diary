### 📌 Topics Covered:
Multer for File Uploads, Handling Multipart Forms, and Basic Image Storage

### 💻 What I Did:
Today was all about enabling file uploads in my Node.js backend using the powerful middleware library **Multer**. I learned how to accept files like images and PDFs through API routes and store them on the local server.

---

### 📦 Installing Multer:
First, I installed Multer:
```bash
npm install multer
```

Then configured it in my server:
```js
import multer from 'multer';

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, 'uploads/');
  },
  filename: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, Date.now() + '-' + file.originalname);
  }
});

const upload = multer({ storage: storage });
```

This allowed me to control **where** and **how** files are stored.

---

### 📤 Creating a File Upload Route:
I created a POST route to handle image uploads:
```js
app.post('/upload', upload.single('image'), (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.file);  // Access uploaded file info
  res.send('File uploaded successfully!');
});
```

Used `upload.single('image')` for single file and `upload.array('photos', 5)` for multiple uploads.

---

### 🧪 Testing:
I tested the route using **Postman**:
- Method: `POST`
- URL: `http://localhost:5000/upload`
- Body: `form-data` with `key = image`, type = file

It worked! The image was saved in the `/uploads` folder.

---

### 🔐 Validating File Type:
To enhance security, I added file type checks:
```js
const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  if (file.mimetype.startsWith('image/')) {
    cb(null, true);
  } else {
    cb(new Error('Only image files are allowed!'), false);
  }
};

const upload = multer({ storage, fileFilter });
```

---

### 🧠 Reflections:
Before today, file uploads always seemed complex. But with Multer, it feels straightforward and reliable. I now understand how form-data is handled on the backend and how to store files in a structured, secure way.

This opens the door for future features like profile pictures, product galleries, and document uploads in full-stack apps.

✅ **Next Goal:** Start building authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for login-protected routes.
