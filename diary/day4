Advanced MongoDB Queries – Projections, Field Filtering, and Script Automation

### 💻 What I Did:
Today, I went deeper into MongoDB and explored **projections**, which allow us to control which fields are returned in the output of a query. Instead of getting all the data, we can include or exclude only the fields we care about.

For example:
```js
// Show only 'name' and hide '_id'
db.users.find({}, { name: 1, _id: 0 });
```

This is incredibly useful when we want to limit the amount of data transferred or focus on only relevant fields for UI display or analytics.

I also practiced **writing reusable MongoDB scripts** in `.js` files. Instead of typing one command at a time in the shell, I can now:
- Store all the logic in a `.js` file
- Run the whole script in one command using the shell

Example:
```js
// mongoScript.js
db = connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/library");

db.books.insertMany([
  { title: "Atomic Habits", author: "James Clear", price: 450 },
  { title: "Ikigai", author: "Francesc Miralles", price: 299 }
]);

db.books.find({}, { title: 1, _id: 0 });
```

To execute it:
```bash
mongo < mongoScript.js
```

This helped me understand the importance of **batch operations** and how databases can be automated just like code.

I also explored:
- How to **filter** data based on multiple conditions
- Using operators like `$or`, `$in`, `$lt`, `$gte` in combination

Example:
```js
db.books.find({
  $or: [
    { price: { $lt: 300 } },
    { author: "James Clear" }
  ]
});
```

### 🧠 Reflections:
Learning about projections made it clearer how to work with data efficiently. I realized that it's not always about storing or retrieving everything — sometimes it's about getting just enough. Also, writing Mongo scripts helped me see MongoDB more like a programming tool rather than just a query terminal. This feels like a powerful way to prepare for real-world applications, especially when working with APIs or backend logic.
