### 📌 Topics Covered:
Setting Up Express.js – Building REST APIs and Handling Requests

### 💻 What I Did:
Today, I shifted focus to **Express.js**, the most popular web framework built on top of Node.js. I learned how to set up a basic Express application and how to run it locally using `node` or `nodemon`.

My first goal was to understand how to create a basic server. I wrote this simple code to get started:
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Express!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

Running this script in the terminal served my app on `http://localhost:3000`, and visiting that in the browser showed the welcome message. This was the first time I saw my Node.js code respond through a browser — an exciting moment!

### 🌐 Handling Different Request Types:
I also explored different HTTP methods and how to handle them:
- `GET` – fetch data
- `POST` – send new data
- `PUT/PATCH` – update existing data
- `DELETE` – remove data
  Here's an example I created to handle both GET and POST:
  ```js
app.get('/students', (req, res) => {
  res.send('List of all students');
});

app.post('/students', (req, res) => {
  res.send('New student added');
});
```

To test these routes, I used [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) — a handy tool for testing APIs — and confirmed that the routes work as expected.

### 📦 Body Parser and Middleware:
I learned that Express can use **middleware** to modify request/response behavior. One common example is parsing JSON body data from `POST` requests:
```js
app.use(express.json());
```

This line lets me read data sent in the body like:
```json
{
  "name": "Riya",
  "age": 22
}
```

### 🧠 Reflections:
Today gave me a practical understanding of how backend APIs work. I began to think in terms of **routes**, **methods**, and **responses**, and realized how essential Express is in building the logic layer of web apps. It's lightweight, flexible, and easy to start with — which makes it perfect for scaling from a small test API to a production-ready backend.
