## 📅 Day 14 - Exploring Middleware & Error Handling in Express
  Today's focus was on understanding how **middleware** works in Express.js and how to implement **error handling** mechanisms effectively. Middleware is one of the most powerful features of Express, enabling request pre-processing, validation, authentication, and logging.

---

### 📘 Topics Covered:
- What is middleware in Express?
- Types of middleware: built-in, third-party, and custom
- Using `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()`
- Creating custom middleware functions
- Error-handling middleware
- Order of middleware execution
- Handling 404 Not Found errors and sending consistent error responses

---

### 🔁 Middleware Breakdown

Learned how middleware functions are executed in order and can either pass control to the next middleware or end the request.

```js
// Built-in middleware
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Custom middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} request received at ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Passes control to the next middleware
});
```

### ❌ Error-Handling Middleware

Used a separate function at the end of all routes to handle unexpected errors and send consistent error responses.

```js
// Error-handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error('Error:', err.message);
  res.status(500).json({ error: 'Something went wrong', message: err.message });
});
```

Also added a generic 404 handler for unmatched routes:

```js
app.use((req, res) => {
  res.status(404).json({ error: 'Route not found' });
});
```

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Middleware is just a function that has access to `req`, `res`, and `next()`.
- `express.json()` is needed to parse incoming JSON payloads (especially for POST requests).
- Custom middleware allows us to apply logic like authentication, logging, or rate limiting.
- Placing error-handling middleware at the end ensures proper fallback for unhandled exceptions.
- Order of middleware is critical — the request flows top to bottom.

---

### ✅ Outcome:
Now I understand how Express apps are structured using layers of middleware and how to handle both expected and unexpected errors gracefully. This makes applications more maintainable and debuggable.
