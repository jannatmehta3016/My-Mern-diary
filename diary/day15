## 📅 Day 15 - Implementing JWT Authentication in Express




Today's goal was to learn how to **secure Express routes using JWT (JSON Web Token)**. This involved understanding token creation, verification, and using middleware to protect API endpoints.

### 🔐 What is JWT?


final Summer training diary
JWT stands for **JSON Web Token** – a compact, URL-safe token used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It's commonly used for authentication in RESTful APIs.

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- `jsonwebtoken` package
- `dotenv` for environment variables
- Express middleware to protect routes

---

### 🧪 Steps Practiced:

1. **Installing JWT package:**
   ```bash
   npm install jsonwebtoken dotenv
   ```

2. **Generating a JWT token:**
   ```js
   const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
   const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user._id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '1h' });
   ```

3. **Sending the token to the client upon login:**
   ```js
   res.json({ token });
   ```

4. **Creating middleware to verify token:**
   ```js
   const verifyToken = (req, res, next) => {
     const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
     const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];

     if (!token) return res.sendStatus(401);

     jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, user) => {
       if (err) return res.sendStatus(403);
       req.user = user;
       next();
     });
   };
   ```

5. **Protecting routes using this middleware:**
   ```js
   app.get('/dashboard', verifyToken, (req, res) => {
     res.json({ message: "Welcome to the dashboard!", user: req.user });
   });
   ```

### 🔑 Key Learnings:

- JWTs are a stateless way to implement authentication, which works well with REST APIs.
- Tokens are signed with a secret and include a payload (user info), a header, and a signature.
- Authentication middleware ensures only authorized users can access protected routes.
- Environment variables (`.env`) are used to store sensitive info like the `JWT_SECRET`.
- Best practice is to include tokens in the `Authorization` header using the "Bearer" scheme.

---

### ✅ Outcome:

I can now implement a basic authentication system in Node.js using JWT. I learned how to protect routes and verify tokens, making the API more secure.

---

📌 **Next Target:** Connect this JWT auth system with the frontend (React) to build a complete login-protected flow.
