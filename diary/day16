## 📅 Day 16 - React Context API Setup: Building Todo App Foundation 


Today I started building a **Todo application** using React Context API. This was homework, and I began by setting up the project structure and understanding how Context API works for state management across components.

---

### 🎯 Objective:

- Set up a new Vite React project for Todo app
- Understand React Context API for state management
- Create the basic project structure with contexts folder
- Build the foundation for todo management

---

### 🛠️ Project Setup:

1. **Created React project with Vite:**
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest 10toDoContextLocal -- --template react
   cd 10toDoContextLocal
   npm install
   ```

2. **Installed dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Project structure created:**
   ```
   src/
     ├── App.jsx
     ├── main.jsx  
     ├── contexts/
     │   └── toDoContext.js
     └── components/
         ├── TodoForm.jsx
         └── TodoItem.jsx
   ```

### 🧠 Context API Foundation:

Started understanding how Context API works as an alternative to prop drilling for state management in React applications.

---

### ✅ Outcome:

- Successfully set up the todo project structure
- Prepared for implementing Context API for state management
- Ready to build todo functionality in next session

---

📌 **Next Target:** Implement todo Context with state management and custom hooks.
