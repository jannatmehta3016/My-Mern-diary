### 📌 Topics Covered:
Environment Variables with dotenv, Express Middleware Deep Dive, and Route Separation

### 💻 What I Did:
Today, I learned how to better structure and secure my backend code. I focused on using **environment variables**, creating **modular Express route files**, and understanding the **power of middleware** in Express.

---

### 🔐 dotenv – Environment Configuration:
I installed the `dotenv` package to manage sensitive data like database URLs, ports, and secret keys. This allowed me to separate configuration from code:
```bash
npm install dotenv
```
Then, I created a `.env` file:
```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp
JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey
```

In my code, I used:
```js
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```

This is a best practice that keeps secrets safe and allows configuration changes without modifying the codebase.

### 🧱 Express Middleware:
I learned that middleware functions are executed in sequence and can:
- Modify the `req` and `res` objects
- End the request-response cycle
- Call the next middleware using `next()`

I created a custom logger middleware like this:
```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
});
```

Also used `express.json()` to parse JSON payloads and `express.static()` to serve static files.

---

### 📁 Route Separation:
To keep my code cleaner, I moved all route logic into separate files:
```js
// routes/userRoutes.js
import express from 'express';
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('User route is working');
});

export default router;
```

Then used it in my main app:
```js
import userRoutes from './routes/userRoutes.js';
app.use('/api/users', userRoutes);
```

This made my project modular and easier to scale.

### 🧠 Reflections:
Today was about writing cleaner, scalable, and more secure backend code. Understanding how to manage environments and separate logic into different files is key for team collaboration and production-readiness.

I'm beginning to feel more like a real-world developer now—building not just "working code," but **maintainable code**.

✅ **Next Goal:** Learn file uploads using `multer` and secure user routes using JWT authentication.
