### 📌 Topics Covered:
Introduction to MongoDB, MongoDB Compass installation, understanding NoSQL databases, basic database and collection creation

### 💻 What I Did:
Today marked the beginning of my MERN Stack training, and I started by diving into **MongoDB**, which is the database part of the stack. I learned that MongoDB is a **NoSQL database**, which means it stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called **documents**, grouped into **collections**.

I installed **MongoDB Compass**, a GUI tool provided by MongoDB, which makes it easy to create and view databases and documents without writing any code. I also installed MongoDB locally and verified that it was running on my system.

Using Compass, I created my first database called `studentsDB` and added a collection named `students`. I inserted some documents manually to understand the structure.

Here's an example of the document I inserted:
```json
{
  "name": "Jannat",
  "age": 20,
  "email": "jannat@example.com",
  "course": "MERN Stack"
}
```
I also explored the concept of schema-less databases, where we don't need to define tables or columns beforehand. This felt very flexible compared to SQL databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

### 🧠 Reflections:
The flexibility of MongoDB was quite surprising and refreshing. I didn't need to worry about creating a strict schema or defining data types upfront. The Compass interface made it very intuitive to insert and view data. As someone used to SQL, working with a document-based model opened a new perspective for me. I'm looking forward to writing queries and connecting MongoDB with Node.js soon. Overall, a strong and promising start to the training!
