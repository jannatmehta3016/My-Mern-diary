## 📅 Day 11 - Connecting Express with MongoDB & Environment Configuration (July 4, 2025)
4 months ago

first commit

Today's focus was on integrating the backend Express server with a MongoDB database using **Mongoose**, and learning how to manage environment variables using `.env` files securely and efficiently.

---

### 🔌 Topics Covered:
- Installing and importing `mongoose`
- Connecting to MongoDB from Express using Mongoose
- Organizing the MongoDB connection logic into a separate config file
- Managing environment variables with `dotenv`
- Using `.env` file to hide sensitive credentials like database URL or JWT secret

---

### 🧪 Practical Experiments:
- Installed Mongoose:
  ```bash
  npm install mongoose
  ```

- Created a `config/db.js` file:
  ```js
  const mongoose = require('mongoose');

  const connectDB = async () => {
    try {
      await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI);
      console.log("MongoDB connected successfully");
    } catch (err) {
      console.error("MongoDB connection failed:", err);
    }
  };

  module.exports = connectDB;
  ```

- Used it in `index.js`:
  ```js
  require('dotenv').config();
  const connectDB = require('./config/db');
  connectDB();
  ```

- Created `.env` file:
  ```env
  PORT=5000
  MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mymernapp
  ```

---

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- `dotenv` helps keep sensitive data like DB URIs or secret keys out of codebase and public repos.
- Mongoose simplifies MongoDB queries and schema modeling.
- Keeping config logic in a separate file helps keep `index.js` clean and improves reusability.

---

### ✅ Outcome:
Now my Express server can communicate securely with MongoDB, and all sensitive credentials are stored in `.env` files, making my application more secure and professional.

📌 **Up Next:** Working with Mongoose schemas and creating models for users and posts.
