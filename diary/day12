## 📅 Day 12 - Creating Mongoose Models & Understanding Schema Design (July 5, 2025)


Today I explored how to define MongoDB document structure using **Mongoose schemas** and how to create reusable models. This was a crucial step to bring structure and validation into MongoDB operations, which otherwise stores documents with a flexible schema.

---

### 📘 Topics Covered:
- Introduction to Schema in MongoDB using Mongoose
- Creating schemas and defining field types
- Adding validation rules like `required`, `default`, and `enum`
- Creating and exporting models for use in Express routes

---

### 🛠️ Hands-On Implementation:

Created a schema for a `User` model:

```js
// models/User.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    minlength: 3,
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true,
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  role: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['user', 'admin'],
    default: 'user',
  },
}, { timestamps: true });

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

Used the model inside a controller:

```js
const User = require('../models/User');

const registerUser = async (req, res) => {
  const { name, email, password } = req.body;
  const newUser = new User({ name, email, password });

  try {
    await newUser.save();
    res.status(201).json({ message: 'User created successfully' });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: err.message });
  }
};
```

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Mongoose lets us enforce structure in MongoDB using schemas, making code more reliable and maintainable.
- Validations like `required`, `unique`, and `enum` are handled automatically before saving to the database.
- Schemas can be extended easily, and models are reusable throughout the project.

---

### ✅ Outcome:
Successfully created a clean and reusable `User` model with validations. I now understand how to design schemas and interact with them through Express endpoints.
